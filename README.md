#  Seismic Detection System

A real-time embedded system designed to detect seismic vibrations using two independent nodes that communicate and validate data collaboratively to generate a reliable earthquake alert.

---

## Problem Statement
Earthquakes and tremors can cause serious damage and risk to human life. Most low-cost systems suffer from false alerts due to noise and lack of cross-validation.

---

##  Objective
To design a system that:
- Independently detects seismic waves using two embedded nodes  
- Exchanges sensor data between nodes using MAC-based communication  
- Compares values with a predefined threshold  
- Classifies the event as either a false alert or a true earthquake

##  Features
- Dual-node independent seismic detection  
- Mutual data validation to reduce false positives  
- Threshold-based decision algorithm  
- Real-time alert generation  
- Reliable and scalable embedded design

##  How It Works

Both System 1 and System 2 continuously monitor ground vibrations using MEMS sensors.  
Each system processes its own sensor data locally and compares it with a predefined threshold.  
The processed data is then exchanged between the two systems using MAC-based wireless communication.  

If both systems confirm abnormal values beyond the threshold, the event is classified as a **✅ True Earthquake**.  
If only one system detects abnormal activity, it is classified as a **❌ False Alert**.

### Step-by-Step Flow
- System 1 continuously monitors ground vibrations using MEMS sensors  
- System 2 continuously monitors ground vibrations using MEMS sensors  

- Each system:
  - Processes its sensor data locally  
  - Compares readings with a predefined threshold  

- Both systems:
  - Exchange processed data using MAC-based wireless communication  
  - Perform cross-validation of sensor values  

- Decision Logic:
  - Both systems exceed threshold → ✅ True Earthquake  
  - Only one system exceeds threshold → ❌ False Alert  

- Final alert is generated using buzzer / LED indicators

##  Seismic Threshold Levels

The system uses acceleration-based thresholds (in *g-force*) to classify seismic activity:

### Wave Detection Thresholds
- P-wave threshold: ~ **0.05 g**  
- S-wave threshold: ~ **0.12 g**  
- Major earthquake: ≥ **0.30 g**

### Decision Classification
- < 0.05 g → Normal / No seismic activity  
- 0.05 g – 0.12 g → P-wave detected (initial tremor)  
- 0.12 g – 0.30 g → S-wave detected (moderate shaking)  
- ≥ 0.30 g → Major earthquake detected  

These thresholds are used by both systems before cross-validation.

##  System Accuracy

Based on experimental testing and calibration:
- Minor vibrations: **85–90%**  
- Moderate vibrations: **90–92%**  
- Strong vibrations: **96–98%**  
- Severe vibrations: **~98%**

Dual-node validation significantly improves reliability and reduces false positives.
